# jarvis.py
1. This is a python program in which we are making a "AI type" program names the Jarvis.

2. We are making this program more advance day by day by adding new security or some other programs in it, Like auot code or the password generator, auto sentence 
  earning (see the auto word gen..py file), smart search, face and object detection, and many more...
  
3. Please try to contribute your ideas for this program to make this realy smart and advance program like jarvis which Tony Stark had in iron-man movie of Marvals.

4. Contributing your ideas for this program doesn't mean that it shoul be a pyhon program... If you think that js or java or C# or any other type of program which you know can
  also make our program better or advance then you are most welcome...
    
5. Please note that, If you think that there is some mistake in any program then please commit that mistake there or if you think that you can fix that mistake then please fix it
  and commit there that, "there was a mistake on <no. of the line> line which i fixed"

6. The .py file (auto word gen) needs a litte bit of work on it before we add build our main jarvis program. To work on this you have to understand the whole main program (jarvis.py) and then you have to understand the "auto word gen" program. Please try to make a team to work on whole 'jarvis' program.

7. Please note that, this repositery have a text file named "firmata file". This file contains a Arduino program which has to be pasted in the Arduino text editer and has to be uploaded to the Arduino borad for the home automation prototype/project.

8. The other programs which we are going to use in our project are:-
  
        8.1. kiwi.py (https://github.com/bunny-k28/kiwi.py/)
        8.2. TensorFlow (https://github.com/bunny-k28/TensorFlow/)
        8.3. openCV (https://github.com/bunny-k28/openCV/)
